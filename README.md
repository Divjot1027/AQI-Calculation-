🌍 Project Title: Air Quality Index (AQI) Analysis Across Indian Monitoring Stations (2020–2024)
📘 Description

This project visualizes and analyzes the Air Quality Index (AQI) data across five major air monitoring stations in India — Anand Vihar, Collectorate, Rajbansi Nagar, Chhoti Gwaltoli, and GVM Corporation — for the years 2020 to 2024.

The objective is to understand how air quality has changed over time, classify the AQI levels into standard categories (Good, Satisfactory, Moderate, Poor, Very Poor, Severe), and compare pollution trends between locations and years.

The dataset categorizes AQI readings into six levels based on India’s National Air Quality Standards, providing a clear view of how frequently each area experiences safe or hazardous air conditions.

🎯 Objectives

Visualize year-wise air quality data for each monitoring station.

Identify seasonal or annual improvement/deterioration trends.

Quantify how often air quality falls under different categories.

Compare pollution patterns between industrial and residential zones.

Create a foundation for applying predictive models (e.g., ML-based AQI forecasting).

⚙️ Methodology

The data is stored in nested arrays for easy manipulation in Python.

The project uses Matplotlib to generate stacked bar charts for visual clarity.

Each color represents an AQI category (from green = Good to dark red = Severe).

Missing or incomplete data (NaN values) are handled gracefully to ensure visualization accuracy.

🧠 Tools and Technologies

Python 3

NumPy (for data handling)

Matplotlib (for data visualization)

Google Colab (for running and sharing notebooks)

🌱 Environmental Significance

Understanding AQI variations helps policymakers and citizens recognize pollution hotspots and track improvements due to interventions such as stricter emission norms, renewable energy adoption, or traffic management.
This project aims to promote data-driven environmental decision-making and raise awareness about the importance of maintaining clean air for sustainable living.
